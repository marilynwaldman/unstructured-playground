# Policy Regarding Religious Observances

Campus policy regarding religious observances requires that faculty make every effort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who, because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments or required attendance. Assignment and case report deadlines are not extended due to religious observance. If you cannot attend a class due to religious observance, please inform the instructor in advance. Please inform the instructor as soon as possible if you have an exam schedule conflict due to religious observance so alternative arrangements can be made.
