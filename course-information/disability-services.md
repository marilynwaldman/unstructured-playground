# Disability Services

  
If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please submit to your professor a letter from Disability Services in a timely manner \(for exam accommodations provide your letter at least one week prior to the exam\) so that your needs can be addressed. Disability Services determines accommodations based on documented disabilities. Contact Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or by e-mail at [dsinfo@colorado.edu](mailto:dsinfo@colorado.edu). If you have a temporary medical condition or injury, see Temporary Injuries under Quick Links at Disability Services website \([http://disabilityservices.colorado.edu/](http://disabilityservices.colorado.edu/)\) and discuss your needs with your professor.
