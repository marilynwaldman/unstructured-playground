# View Jupyter Notebooks

#### How to use NBViewer to view the notebook online

You can use [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) to check out a Jupyter notebook hosted on GitHub. You only need to input the GitHub URL link into the input box.

#### Codes on NBViewer is not updated

Sometimes, you change codes after first preview on NBViewer. You find the codes are updated on GitHub. However, NBViewer still shows the outdated codes used before. This is a common "cache" problem. You can try to trigger a cache invalidation by adding query string in the URL.

Suppose this is your original NBviewer link:

```text
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/xxxxx/yyyyy.ipynb
```

You can add anything after the `?` mark:

```text
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/xxxxx/yyyyy.ipynb?fffffff
```

The `fffffff` here can be arbitrary. Note, in your submission of the work, if the an NBviewer link is required, please paste the one that shows exactly the result you want, i.e. the one with some taililng querystring with which you can see the latest result. Or else, we may see the old content.
