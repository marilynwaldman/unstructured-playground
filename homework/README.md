# Homework

Each week you will be assigned homework in order to gain practical experience. This is the most important component of the class \(in a perfect world your grade would be based 100% on homework\).

It is fine to work in groups, but every student will individually submit artifacts \(e.g. source code, screenshots, data files, etc\). All will be individually graded. Late submissions will automatically receive a 10% deduction for every day the assignment is late. Homework will be submitted online via Canvas.

You should try EVERY line of code in the tutorials yourself, and from scratch. DO NOT copy/paste. Learning to code involves a surprising amount of "muscle memory". The hours of frustrated fiddling \(on niggling details\) will turn you into a wizard, and wizards make $$$.
